**Getting text from Images**
This project helps to extract text from images using OCR.

OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition.

It is a technology that recognizes text within a digital image.

Here we used pytesseract library to perform OCR.

It is used to recognize text in scanned documents.

OCR software processes a digital image by locating and recognizing characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols.

The extracted text can be used for a variety of editing purposes.

You can use this project to scan text from image files.

It works based on computer vision.

The depending libraries are :

pytesseract - can read and recognize text in images and is commonly used in python ocr image to text use cases.

cv2 - module in OpenCV that provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for working with image and video processing functions.

tkinter - used to construct basic graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

Pyperclip - provides a cross-platform Python module for copying and pasting text to the clipboard.

Files:

| gui.py provides a GUI and will allow users to select and crop image from our system to extract text from it.
